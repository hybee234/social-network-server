## Description

Huber's social network backend is a server designed on a MongoDB platform. Its purpose is to connect the front-end social network application

High level features of the server are:

* User management
* Enabling users to express their thoughts on the platform
* Enabling other users to respond to thoughts with reactions
* Allowing users to connect and become friends with one another.

This application has been developed without starting code

## User Story <a ID="user-story"></a>

This server was developed with this user story in mind:


```md
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## User Acceptance Criteria <a ID="user-acceptance-criteria"></a>

### This server was developed with the below User acceptance criteria:

```
GIVEN a social network API

WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database

WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database

WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
```

### Additional requirements:

* Monogoose package must be used to connect to MongoDB database
* Express JS package must be used for routing

## Usage

As this is purely a backend social-network server, utilise an API development platform like <a href="https://insomnia.rest/">Insomnia </a> to transmit API requests

Available APIs are as followeds

| Users                   | API                                      | 
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | 
| GET all users:          | http://localhost:3001/api/users/         | 
| GET one user:           | http://localhost:3001/api/users/:userId  | 
| POST one user:          | http://localhost:3001/api/users          | 
| PUT one user by ID:     | http://localhost:3001/api/users/:userId  | 
| DELETE one user by ID:  | http://localhost:3001/api/users/:userId  | 

Category POST/PUT sample JSON body:
```
{
	"username" : "test1",
	"email" : "a@b.com"
}
```
** GET ONE user will also obtain detail information about thoughts and reactions
** DELETE one user will also delete thoughts authored by that user

*** UP TO HERE ***

| Thoughts                  | API                                    | 
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | 
| GET all Product:          | http://localhost:3001/api/products/    | 
| GET one Product by ID:    | http://localhost:3001/api/products/:id | 
| POST one Product          | http://localhost:3001/api/products/    |  
| PUT one Product by ID:    | http://localhost:3001/api/products/:id |
| DELETE one Product by ID: | http://localhost:3001/api/products/:id |

Product POST/PUT sample JSON body:
 ```
 {
	"product_name": "basketball",
	"price" : 30.00,
	"stock" : 3,
	"tagIds" : ["1", "2", "3", "4"]
 }
 ```

| Tags                  |                                    |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| GET all Tag:          | http://localhost:3001/api/tags/    |
| GET one Tag by ID:    | http://localhost:3001/api/tags/:id |
| POST one Tag          | http://localhost:3001/api/tags/    |
| PUT one Tag by ID:    | http://localhost:3001/api/tags/:id |
| DELETE one Tag by ID: | http://localhost:3001/api/tags/:id |

Tag POST/PUT sample JSON body:
```
{
"tag_name" : "ball"
}
```


The below SQL can be used to pull table data across the 4 tables used in this server:
```
--All values from all tables
SELECT
p.id as product_id,
p.product_name,
p.price,
p.stock, 
t.id as tag_id,
t.tag_name,
pt.id as producttag_id,
c.id as category_id,
c.category_name
FROM product p
LEFT JOIN product_tag pt on pt.product_id = p.id
LEFT JOIN tag t on t.id = pt.tag_id
LEFT JOIN category c ON p.category_id = c.id;
```
