## User Story <a ID="user-story"></a>

This server was developed with this user story in mind:


```md
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## User Acceptance Criteria

### This server was developed with the below User acceptance criteria:

```
GIVEN a social network API

WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database

WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database

WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
```

### Additional requirements:

* Mongoose package must be used to connect to MongoDB database
* Express JS package must be used for routing

## Usage

As this is purely a backend social-network server, utilise an API development platform like <a href="https://insomnia.rest/">Insomnia </a> to transmit API requests

Available APIs are as followeds

| Users                   | API                                      | 
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | 
| GET all users:          | http://localhost:3001/api/users/         | 
| GET one user:           | http://localhost:3001/api/users/:userId  | 
| POST one user:          | http://localhost:3001/api/users          | 
| PUT one user by ID:     | http://localhost:3001/api/users/:userId  | 
| DELETE one user by ID:  | http://localhost:3001/api/users/:userId  | 

Category POST/PUT sample JSON body:
```
{
	"username" : "User123",
	"email" : "User@email.com"
}
```
** GET ONE user will also obtain detail information about thoughts and reactions
** DELETE one user will also delete thoughts authored by that user
